    <h2>Method</h2>
    <b>Crispy Cauliflower</b>
    <p>1. Cut or break the cauliflower into medium-size florets.</p>
    <p>2. Combine the flour, corn flour, white pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix and slowly pour water while mixing the batter. Keep adding water until you have a thickish batter (around ½ cup).</p>
    <p>3. Add the cauliflower florets into the batter and using a spatula, toss the florets until they are properly coated.</p>
    <p>4. Add oil to a saucepan or a pan for deep frying and heat over medium heat.</p>
    <p>5. When the oil is hot enough, add the battered cauliflower in batches so you don't overcrowd the pan. When golden, transfer to a plate with a paper towel and set aside.</p>
    <br>

    <p>3. Add water, stir and cook for a few minutes.</p>
    <p>4. Dilute the corn flour in the water and add to the wok. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes and remove from the cooker.</p>
