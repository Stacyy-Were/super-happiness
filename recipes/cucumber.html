    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>1 bottle vegetable oil for frying</p>
    <br>
    <b>Veggies</b>
    <p>2 large sliced cucumbers</p>
    <br>

    <b>Dry Mix</b>
    <p>
        1 cup flour
        1.5 tbsp salt
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>Wet Mix</b>
    <p>
        2 cups flour
        2 cups water
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>Crunchy Top Coating</b>
    <p>
        1.5 cup panko plain or flavored
        1/2 cup flour
        1 TBSP poultry spice blend or chicken rub blend
        1/2 tspn paprika optional
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>1. Heat oil for frying to 350 degrees.</p>
    <p>2. Slice cucumber into medium-sized disks or any shape you'd like.</p>
    <p>3. Grab 3 bowls. Combine dry mix into a bowl. Wisk the wet mix into its own bowl. Combined crunchy top mix into its own bowl.</p>
    <p>4. With your right hand, drop a piece of cucumber into the dry mixture. Coat all sides and shake off excess. Drop into the wet mixture.</p>
    <p>5. With your left hand, flip the cucumber around to get it well coated in the wet mixture. Shake off any excess, then drop it into the crunchy top mixture.</p>
    <p>6. With your right hand, add some crunchy mixture to the cucumber and push it into all sides. Gently remove the cucumber and place it on a baking sheet. Repeat until all the cucumber slices are coated.</p>
    <p>7. Once the oil is hot, fry the cucumber in small batches. They'll cook quickly, so remove them once golden brown. *If your oil is too cold, then the batter will come out soggy, so start with one cucumber.</p>
