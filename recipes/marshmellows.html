    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3><b>Marshmallows</b></h3>
    <p>    
        175 g Chickpea Aquafaba (see notes)<br>
        ½ tsp Xanthan Gum Powder<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <b>Dry Ingredients</b>
    <p>
        400 g Vegan Granulated Sugar (Caster sugar also fine. See notes)<br>
        2 tsp Agar Agar Powder (not flakes)<br>
        ¼ tsp Locust Bean Gum (mostly for flavor, so can omit)<br>
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>Wet Ingredients</b>
    <p> 
        115 g Light Corn Syrup<br>
        135 g Water<br>
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>Add-ins</b>
    <p>
        1 tsp Vanilla Extract (see notes)<br>
        ½ tsp Kosher Salt<br>
        Vegan Food Coloring, optional<br>
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>Coating</b>
    <p>
        ½ cup Dessicated Coconut<br>
        <i>- or -</i><br>
        ¼ cup Tapioca Starch (or cornstarch)<br>
        2 Tbsp Organic Powdered Sugar (see notes)<br>
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>Notes</b>
    <p>
        Aquafaba is the liquid leftover from beans. Chickpeas have the best aquafaba for dessert uses. 175 g is roughly the amount of aquafaba you can get from one 14 oz | 425 g tin
        <br>
        Some sugars are processed with bone char, making them non veg. Really cheap sugar (which is usually made with beets, which don’t need bleaching), and organic sugars don’t use bone char. Organic powdered sugar also uses tapioca starch (aka tapioca flour) instead of cornstarch, so it has a better flavor
        <br>
        Any flavor extracts will work. Peppermint, coconut, maple, almond, etc
        <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>1. Line an 8 x 8 | 20 cm x 20 cm baking dish with parchment paper. Alternately, if piping into molds (if needed. Silicone molds need no prep), prep a piping bag for easy filling. Set aside. (Note: this marshmallow recipe is fairly pipeable immediately after it’s made, so if you wish to pipe it, just move quickly)</p>
    <p>2. In large mixing bowl or bowl of stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, begin whipping aquafaba & xanthan gum at medium speed. Continue whipping while sugar syrup is being made. The longer it can go, the more it will increase in volume, the lighter and fluffier the marshmallow</p>
    <p>3. In a small or medium saucepan, thoroughly whisk together dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients to the saucepan. Turn heat to medium. Whisk mixture until bubbling, 5-10 minutes</p>
    <p>4. Turn heat to medium-high and clip on a digital candy thermometer. Do not stir! Stirring can cause the mixture to seize. When the temperature reaches 250F | 121C (hard ball stage), immediately remove from heat</p>
    <p>5. Once the aquafaba is stiff, opaque and greatly increased in volume and the sugar syrup has reached 250F | 121C, slowly pour in the sugar syrup as the beater continues to whisk. Scrape bowl as needed</p>
    <p>6. After a couple of minutes of continued whisking, add in the vanilla extract (or whichever flavor extract you're using, if any), kosher salt and food coloring (if using)</p>
    <p>7. Continue to mix until all new additions are thoroughly incorporated.</p> 
    <p>8. Pour into prepared pan, or scoop mixture into piping bag and pipe into molds or onto cupcakes, etc. Place in fridge to set for about 30 minutes</p>
    <p>9. Prepare coating in large bowl (either desiccated coconut, or whisk together tapioca starch and organic powdered)</p>
    <p>10. Peel from molds or cut marshmallows as desired and toss in coating. If cutting with a shaped cutter, dip it often in the coating to keep it from getting too sticky</p>
    <p>11. Place coated marshmallows on drying rack for at least a couple hours, up to overnight. Store in an airtight container at room temp</p>
